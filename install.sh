# Polycode bootstrap installer.
#
# Downloads an official release binary, verifies its SHA-256 against the
# release's own SHA256SUMS, confirms the binary reports the version the release
# claims, installs it into a user-owned directory with an atomic rename, and
# then asks the installed binary to record itself as an official installation
# so `polycode update` works later.
#
#   curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/escapemanuele/polycode/main/install.sh | sh
#
# Everything is configured through the environment, because a script run this
# way cannot receive flags:
#
#   POLYCODE_VERSION=0.1.1     install that exact release instead of the latest
#   POLYCODE_INSTALL_DIR=DIR   install into DIR instead of ~/.local/bin
#   POLYCODE_FORCE=1           replace a file at the destination that Polycode
#                              does not recognize as its own installation
#
# This script never uses sudo, never touches a repository, never edits shell
# configuration, and never installs anything it has not verified.
