# Control room (TUI)

Watch and drive every run from one terminal screen without touching the database, Git or tmux yourself.

## Sub-features
- runs-screen: list of runs; archive/unarchive runs; delete an archived run for good; Enter opens detail.
- missions-screen: `M` lists every mission with its integrated/total packages and how many need you; the right column shows the selected mission's goal, its packages one line each in plain words (`ready to start`, `working`, `needs you`, `done, bring it in`, `in`, `waits on <deps>`), and its "Needs you". Enter opens the mission: packages as a rail, the selected package's contract, run and delivered evidence on the right, and "Needs you" as sentences that name the package and the key that answers it (`Core asks: Bash ./greet.sh   u answer`, `Core is done   I bring it in`). Every action works from the mission without descending: `S` starts a ready package's child run with the composer's current Execution and Effort choices, `u` opens the attention overlay for a package whose run is asking, `I` brings a finished package in (confirmation; applies the run if it is not applied yet, then records the package, and packages that waited on it become ready), `A` arms auto-approve for every run serving the mission now and for the runs this session starts for it. Enter opens the package's run in run detail for the details, and Esc from there returns to the mission. Planning (adding, revising, deciding, retrying, cancelling) is CLI-only for now.
- run-detail: stage timeline, routes, attention, usage; `i` toggles the technical (evidence) view; `e` expands the rail's one-line task to the whole thing, offered only when that line dropped something. Opening a failed run lands the selection on the blocking failed stage, whose hero carries a `WHY IT FAILED` section with the whole (sanitized, 200-char capped) provider reason; the Runs-screen overview shows the same section for a failed run before it is opened.
- activity-strip: one prose sentence for what is happening now — a failed stage's own reason ("Implementation failed: compile failed"), or why a stage has not started ("Waiting on: Architecture", "Blocked: Quality review failed, Spec review was skipped", "Waiting on you", "Stage suspended", "Stage skipped by the workflow").
- viewers: artifact (`o`/Enter, `m` raw/rendered), raw process logs (`l`), workspace diff (`d`).
- composer: `n` opens the new-run form (Task, Workflow, Repository, Execution, Effort).
- actions: resume, stop, retry, attention, apply, rebase, publish, fix, continue, follow-ups, discard, delete, all through one serialized worker.
- update-prompt: an overlay offering to install a newer official release; lowest priority overlay.
- help: `?` overlay listing every key.

## How to get to it (user POV)
Run `polycode` with no arguments in an interactive terminal, or `polycode tui`. Non-interactive stdin/stdout prints CLI help instead. The TUI starts on the Runs screen with the current directory as the composer's repository. Quitting (`q`, Ctrl-C) stops the runs this session shows as `Running` before it closes, reporting "Stopping N agents…" while it waits.

## Driving it
```bash
polycode
polycode tui
```
Global: `↑`/`↓` or `j`/`k` navigate, `PageUp`/`PageDown` scroll by 10, `Home`/`End` top/bottom in viewers, `Enter` or `→` open/confirm (one level in: a run from the list, a stage's result from run detail, a mission from the missions list, a package's run from the mission), `Esc` or `←` back/close (one level out; the composer keeps its own arrows, so `Esc` alone leaves it), `n` new run, `R` runs screen, `M` missions screen, `x` dismiss notification, `?` help, `q` or `Ctrl-C` quit/detach.
Mission: `↑`/`↓` select a package, `Enter` open its current run, `S` start the selected ready package (uses the composer's Execution and Effort; the starting card follows it, and the package row says `working` once it runs), `u` answer what the selected package's run asks (the attention overlay; Enter approves, Ctrl-S skips, a typed response continues without granting), `I` bring the selected finished package in (Enter confirms; applies the run when needed), `A` auto-approve permission requests for this mission's runs (session-scoped intention: arms the runs it has now and the ones this session starts for it). Run actions (`s`, `a`, `X`, …) are not bound on the mission screens.
Run detail: `Enter`/`o` open selected stage artifact, `r` resume/recover, `s` stop, `t` retry selected failed stage (chooser: Configured provider / Claude / Codex, Enter retries; a stage whose model Codex refused also gets `Codex on <fallback model>`, highlighted on open), `u` attention overlay, `A` arm/disarm automatic approval of this run's permission requests, `l` raw logs, `d` workspace diff, `a` apply (Enter confirms), `b` rebase the run's change onto the checkout's current HEAD (Enter confirms; a conflict changes nothing, and verification has to run again before apply), `P` pull request (Enter confirms; a spinning card times the publish, Esc hides it without stopping it; the result card holds the URL until dismissed: `o` opens it in the browser, `y` copies it, Enter/Esc close and leave the summary in the footer), `X` discard (Enter confirms), `f` fix, `c` continue, `w` follow-ups, `e` expand the task in the rail, `i` technical details.
Runs list: `h` archive/unarchive selected run, `H` show/hide archived runs, `D` delete an archived run for good (POD stands at the plunger; a second `D` goes through, Esc cancels). Only an archived run offers `D`.
Artifact viewer: `m` toggle raw/rendered Markdown.
Composer: `Tab`/`Shift-Tab` move fields, `←`/`→` cycle Workflow, Execution and Effort, typing/paste edits Task and Repository, `Enter` submits, `Esc` back.
Update overlay: `↑`/`↓` toggle Yes/No, `Enter` confirm, `Esc` dismiss for this process.

## Where it lives
- `src/tui/input.rs` — `map_key` / `map_text_key`: the only key-to-intent tables.
- `src/tui/app.rs` — `handle_intent`, overlay handlers, composer submit, eligibility messages (`stop_unavailable_reason`, `fix_unavailable_reason`, `continue_unavailable_reason`).
- `src/tui/state.rs` — `Screen`, `Overlay`, `NewRunForm`, `ExecutionChoice`, `EFFORT_CHOICES`/`effort_label`, `CONCURRENT_AGENTS` (4); `replace_missions`/`replace_mission`/`move_package` hold the missions screen's cursor.
- `src/tui/render.rs` — `render_missions`, `render_mission_detail`, `package_hero`, `mission_visual`/`package_visual`, `render_integrate_confirmation`.
- `src/tui/worker.rs` — `WorkerCommand::StartPackage` / `IntegratePackage` run through `MissionService` on the worker thread.
- `src/tui/render.rs` — rendering incl. the help overlay text; `status_sentences`, `waiting_message`, `blocked_message` compose the activity strip; `failed_stage_reason` / `failure_reason_lines` render the failure block in the hero and the Runs overview.
- `src/tui/state.rs` — `focus_blocking_failure` moves the selection onto the blocking failed stage when a run is opened from the Runs screen.
- `src/tui/worker.rs` — `WorkerCommand` enum; one standard thread serializes all mutations.
- `src/tui/terminal.rs` — raw mode / alternate screen RAII and panic restore.
- `src/tui/theme.rs`, `src/tui/motion.rs` — appearance (see configuration.md).
- `src/lib.rs` — `frontend_mode`: no command + interactive terminal opens the TUI.
- `tests/cli.rs` — `no_args_non_tty_prints_help_and_explicit_tui_fails_without_control_sequences`.

## Gotchas
- Text mode (Task/Repository fields, attention and continue overlays) uses `map_text_key`: letters are input, not commands. `q` does not quit there; Ctrl-C still does.
- Quit stops running runs but never discards or applies anything; a stopped run resumes. Quitting with agents at work therefore takes as long as their stops do, one after another. Reopen and press `r` to reconcile durable state and consume retained output.
- Startup sweeps the worktrees of `Applied` and `Discarded` runs on a background thread; nothing reports it, and a `Completed` run's worktree is never touched.
- Read paths are side-effect free except the 30 s abandoned-run observe pass; they never acknowledge provider output or create apply intent.
- The TUI caps concurrently working agents at 4 (`CONCURRENT_AGENTS`); a booked fix that cannot start yet stays booked silently. The CLI has no such cap.
- Attention overlays outrank the update overlay; the update prompt is shown at most once per process.
- The activity strip is width-bounded: a long provider reason is cut with an ellipsis, and the prefix naming the stage always survives the cut. The full text is in the failed stage's hero (`WHY IT FAILED`), the Runs-screen overview, the logs (`l`) and `polycode status`.
- Stop dispatches without confirmation; apply, rebase, publish, discard and bring-in require Enter in a confirmation overlay.
- Mission auto-approve (`A`) is remembered by the session, not the store: a run the CLI starts for the mission later is not armed. Like a run's own `A`, it approves only requests Claude Code can grant as a rule; a request to execute a script still stops the run and shows under "Needs you".
- The mission screens observe their runs on every refresh (the same committed-status pass `polycode mission show` makes); they never drive a run. A package's run started from the TUI counts against `CONCURRENT_AGENTS` like any other start.
