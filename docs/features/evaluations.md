# Evaluations

Measure one provider/model candidate on one engineering role against source-controlled cases with deterministic oracles, without touching production runs or routing.

## Sub-features
- list: prints each suite version, its fingerprint and cases (`role=`, `workflow=`).
- run: materializes a fresh fixture repository per repetition, drives the normal engine with an `eval_v1` routing plan (candidate on the target role, Fake on every other role), scores, and writes evidence.
- report: aggregates one or more result files/directories by suite version and target; never picks a winner.
- suites: `role_core_v1` (immutable, default), `role_core_v2` (calibrated reviewer fixtures), `role_core_v3` (hygiene successor backing `recommended_v2`).
- statuses: `Passed`, `Failed` (benchmark failure), `InfrastructureFailure` (fixture, provider, tmux, artifact, apply, safety).

## How to get to it (user POV)
Run `polycode eval list` to see suites and cases. Run a candidate with `polycode eval run`; native providers need `--allow-native-usage` on every invocation. Evidence lands under `~/.polycode/evals/<evaluation-id>/<case-id>/rep-NNN/` unless `--out` is given. Read summaries with `polycode eval report`. There are no evaluation controls in the TUI.

## Driving it
```bash
polycode eval list
polycode eval run --provider fake                                   # suite defaults to role_core_v1
polycode eval run --suite role_core_v3 --provider fake
polycode eval run --suite role_core_v3 --provider codex --repeat 3 --allow-native-usage
polycode eval run --suite role_core_v3 --provider claude --model <model> --allow-native-usage --out <dir>
polycode eval run --suite role_core_v3 --provider codex --effort medium --repeat 3 --allow-native-usage
polycode eval report ~/.polycode/evals/<evaluation-id>
polycode eval report <codex-results> <claude-results>
```
Flags on `eval run`: `--suite <version>` (default `role_core_v1`), `--provider claude|codex|fake` (required), `--model <id>`, `--effort native|low|medium|high|xhigh` (default native; recorded as `requested_effort` on every result), `--repeat <n>` (default 1), `--allow-native-usage`, `--out <path>`.

## Where it lives
- `src/cli/mod.rs` — `EvalCommand`, `EvalRunArgs`.
- `src/cli/commands.rs` — `eval`, `run_eval` (per-case progress lines and ✓/✗/! marks).
- `src/eval/case.rs` — cases and ground truth; fixture files embedded with `include_str!` from `evals/`.
- `src/eval/suite.rs` — `EvalSuite::load`, fingerprints.
- `src/eval/runner.rs` — isolated roots, `allow_native_usage` gate, `default_output_directory`.
- `src/eval/scorer.rs` — deterministic implementer/quality/spec scoring.
- `src/eval/result.rs`, `src/eval/report.rs` — `EvalResultV1` codec and report rendering.
- `evals/role_core_v1/`, `evals/role_core_v2/`, `evals/role_core_v3/` — fixture repositories (`Cargo.toml`, `src/lib.rs`, `.gitignore`, sometimes `Cargo.lock`).
- `tests/eval_cli.rs` — list output, native opt-in gate, synthetic Fake results, controlled Codex run.

## Gotchas
- The final arbiter of an eval is the harness (diff scope, trusted validation, structured artifact matching), never the agent's self-reported success. A successful terminal with only denied Bash/read history completes and is then scored; only a mutation request, a question or an unknown tool needs a human (`requires_eval_terminal_attention`).
- `--allow-native-usage` consent is never stored; omit it and a native run stops before any output directory is created.
- Fake results carry `synthetic = true` and cannot support Recommended policy.
- Eval runs never open `~/.polycode/polycode.db` and never appear in `polycode runs`; deleting `~/.polycode/evals` has zero production effect.
- V1, V2 and V3 result groups are never averaged together in reports.
- Fixture files are compiled into the binary via `include_str!`; editing `evals/` changes the suite fingerprint, and `role_core_v1`/`v2` are meant to stay byte-identical history.
- Architect, Researcher and EngineeringLead have no cases on purpose.
- Reviewer candidates run with the change handoff since M13a.5; pre- and post-handoff native result sets are not perfectly comparable even though the suite fingerprint is unchanged.
