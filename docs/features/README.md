# Feature Map

This directory tells a coding agent what each user-facing Polycode feature does, how a user reaches it, the exact commands and keys that drive it, where it lives in code, and its known traps. It is not an architecture document; see `../../ARCHITECTURE.md` for that.
Open the relevant feature file before touching or driving that feature.
Every command, flag and key here is copied from `src/cli/mod.rs` and `src/tui/input.rs`; if they disagree with a file below, the code is right and the file is stale.

## Features

| Feature | Purpose | File |
|---|---|---|
| Run lifecycle | Start, inspect, stop, resume, recover, retry and resolve one run | [run-lifecycle.md](run-lifecycle.md) |
| Workflows | Built-in Fast/Standard/Deep/Review graphs plus fix and continue cycles | [workflows.md](workflows.md) |
| Control room | Ratatui TUI: screens, overlays, exact keys | [control-room.md](control-room.md) |
| Workspace | Isolated worktrees, apply, discard, pull request | [workspace.md](workspace.md) |
| Routing | Roles to providers/models, `--provider`, `--profile recommended`, v1 frozen / v2 current | [routing.md](routing.md) |
| Native providers | Claude Code and Codex adapters, permissions, sandboxes, attention | [providers.md](providers.md) |
| Evaluations | `eval list/run/report`, suites under `evals/`, evidence layout | [evaluations.md](evaluations.md) |
| Observability and effort | Usage/latency/prompt-bytes telemetry and `--effort` | [observability-and-effort.md](observability-and-effort.md) |
| Configuration and appearance | Data/config paths and the environment variables the TUI reads | [configuration.md](configuration.md) |
| Install, update, doctor | Bootstrap installer, self-update, environment check | [install-update-doctor.md](install-update-doctor.md) |
| Process supervision | tmux-backed managed processes, `__run-process`, `__exec-process` | [process-supervision.md](process-supervision.md) |
| Release | Tagging, the release gate, PR discipline | [release.md](release.md) |

## Keeping this map current

When code under a feature's "Where it lives" paths changes, update that feature file in the same PR. Add a new file and a table row when a new user-facing feature lands; delete both when one is removed.

`cargo test --test feature_map` runs in CI and checks the mechanical part: every cited path exists, every `polycode ...` line in a `Driving it` block is a command with flags the binary accepts, every key named in control-room.md is bound in `src/tui/input.rs`. A rename or a removed flag turns the map red instead of stale.

The semantic part is a reading job. At the end of every milestone, an agent runs this pass:

1. For each feature file, open every path under "Where it lives" and compare with the file: sub-features that exist in code but have no line, lines that describe code that is gone, defaults and status names that changed.
2. For each gotcha, find the code or test that makes it true. If none exists any more, delete the gotcha.
3. Check README.md and ARCHITECTURE.md against the same code; those two drift the same way.
4. Open one PR titled `docs: feature map pass after <milestone>` with only those edits.

A stale entry looks like one of these:

- A command, flag, subcommand or key that `polycode --help`, `src/cli/mod.rs` or `src/tui/input.rs` no longer has, or has under a different name.
- A "Where it lives" path that `ls` cannot find.
- A status name, default value, profile version or suite version that the code no longer uses.
- A gotcha describing a bug that has been fixed.
- A sub-feature that exists in code but has no line here.
