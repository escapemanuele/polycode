# Polycode Orchestration

Polycode coordinates recoverable engineering work performed by native coding-agent providers while preserving explicit human control over run progress and results.

## Language

**Run**:
A recoverable orchestration effort bound for its lifetime to one immutable input and one effective configuration snapshot.
_Avoid_: Job, execution

**Run input**:
Immutable normalized user intent for one run, stored separately from mutable lifecycle state and effective configuration. Leading/trailing whitespace is removed; internal Unicode and line breaks are preserved.
_Avoid_: Task field in Run, provider prompt, mutable description

**Stage**:
A resumable unit of engineering work within a run, with declared dependencies and one terminal outcome.
_Avoid_: Step, phase

**Run status**:
The run's current lifecycle condition, including a ready boundary after preparation and before execution. Cleanup is not a run status.
_Avoid_: Run state

**Stage status**:
The stage's current lifecycle condition. Ready means dependencies were checked and work is eligible to start.
_Avoid_: Stage state

**Execution-finished**:
A lifecycle condition with no active work. Failed work may still be retried, and a completed run may still be applied or discarded.
_Avoid_: Terminal

**Lifecycle-closed**:
A condition that rejects normal future lifecycle mutation: applied or discarded for a run, completed or skipped for a stage.
_Avoid_: Finished, terminal

**Ready**:
An atomic lifecycle boundary where preparation or dependency validation succeeded, but execution has not started.
_Avoid_: Waiting, pending

**Paused**:
A deliberate suspension requested by the user and eligible to resume from the condition that was suspended.
_Avoid_: Stopped, interrupted

**Interrupted**:
An unplanned suspension caused by loss of the active process or runtime, eligible for recovery from the condition that was interrupted.
_Avoid_: Paused, failed

**Resume**:
Continue deliberately paused work from its saved condition.
_Avoid_: Recover, retry

**Recover**:
Continue unexpectedly interrupted work from its saved condition.
_Avoid_: Resume, retry

**Attention request**:
A persisted, uniquely identified request for human permission, a decision, or an answer before affected work can continue. Multiple pending requests preserve creation order across pause or interruption.
_Avoid_: Needs-you signal, prompt

**Retry**:
An explicit decision that returns a failed stage to pending. Retry remains available while every downstream stage is pending or ready; recovery never silently retries failed work.
_Avoid_: Resume, recover

**Required dependency**:
A predecessor whose successful completion is necessary before a stage is ready.
_Avoid_: Hard dependency

**Optional dependency**:
A predecessor that must reach an outcome before a stage is ready, but whose unsuccessful outcome permits degraded progress.
_Avoid_: Soft dependency

**Degraded readiness**:
Readiness achieved after one or more optional dependencies ended unsuccessfully, preserving that reduced-evidence condition.
_Avoid_: Partial success

**Configuration snapshot**:
The immutable effective configuration selected when a run is created and reused for every recovery or resume of that run.
_Avoid_: Current configuration, config copy

**Execution target**:
One immutable provider plus optional configured model selected for an engineering role. A missing model means that provider's native configured/default model, not a model name resolved today.
_Avoid_: Provider alone, confirmed model, current default model

**Routing plan**:
The validated immutable role-to-execution-target map inside a configuration snapshot. Routes are resolved when a run is created and loaded by pure lookup on restart.
_Avoid_: Workflow provider choice, mutable route table, runtime resolver

**Uniform routing**:
A routing plan created from explicit `--provider`, assigning every distinct role used by one workflow to the same execution target.
_Avoid_: Single-provider engine, routing bypass

**Recommended profile**:
A versioned source-controlled creation-time policy that probes native provider availability, resolves explicit role routes, and persists them. Provider loss after creation never re-routes existing work.
_Avoid_: Live recommendation, runtime fallback, benchmark claim

**Application service**:
The use-case boundary coordinating repository discovery, atomic creation, workspace lifecycle, provider reconstruction, scheduler commands, and committed query results.
_Avoid_: CLI command handler, domain aggregate

**Control room**:
An ephemeral local projection and command surface over durable run state and application use cases. It never owns orchestration state, execution, provider output consumption, or workspace mutation.
_Avoid_: Execution engine, canonical dashboard, database client

**Frontend detach**:
Ending one local client connection to a run without interrupting its managed provider, changing lifecycle state, or disposing workspace changes.
_Avoid_: Stop, cancel, discard

**Evaluation suite**:
A human-versioned, source-controlled collection of role-specific cases whose meaning remains stable across result sets.
_Avoid_: Generic benchmark, live leaderboard

**Evaluation case**:
One stable scenario pairing an engineering role with disposable repository evidence and an independent deterministic oracle.
_Avoid_: Production run, prompt sample

**Evaluation target**:
One candidate provider plus optional configured model measured for exactly one role while support roles remain synthetic.
_Avoid_: Role route, Recommended profile, winner

**Evaluation result**:
Versioned evidence from one case repetition, preserving candidate identity, fixture identity, role metrics, usage, latency, and failure classification outside production run history.
_Avoid_: Routing policy, benchmark row in Run

**Benchmark failure**:
A measured candidate outcome that violates a case criterion, such as failed behavior, scope drift, missed finding, or false positive.
_Avoid_: Provider outage, harness failure

**Evaluation infrastructure failure**:
Failure of fixture, provider availability, supervision, protocol, artifact integrity, apply, or safety boundary that prevents trustworthy candidate scoring.
_Avoid_: Model failure, zero score

**Quiescence**:
A durable condition where synchronous execution has no immediate legal work: completed, awaiting attention, paused, interrupted, failed, applied, discarded, or provider-delayed.
_Avoid_: Every stop is an error, busy polling

**Run snapshot**:
A versioned persisted representation of current run state, accepted into the domain only after migration and full invariant validation.
_Avoid_: Serialized run, event replay

**Run workspace**:
The separately persisted physical Git resource assigned to one run: source repository identity, immutable base commit, managed worktree, and optional owned branch. It is infrastructure state, not part of the run snapshot.
_Avoid_: Repository fields in Run, execution directory

**Workspace mode**:
The explicit Git shape of a run workspace: branch-backed for implementation work or detached for review-only work.
_Avoid_: Mode inferred from branch text

**Workspace status**:
The recoverable lifecycle of the physical Git resource: preparing, ready, removing, removed, or broken. It does not determine run status.
_Avoid_: Run status, filesystem existence alone

**Workspace intent**:
A durable declaration of an intended Git resource change recorded before its non-transactional filesystem effect.
_Avoid_: Best-effort metadata, open database transaction around Git

**Workspace reconciliation**:
Validation of persisted workspace intent against current Git/filesystem evidence, followed only by a safe idempotent completion or an explicit broken outcome.
_Avoid_: Blind retry, filesystem inference

**Base commit**:
The immutable commit from which a run workspace was created and against which its apply delta is generated.
_Avoid_: Current source HEAD, mutable branch tip

**Rehydration data**:
Persistence-neutral, untrusted current-state input consumed by `Run::rehydrate`; it is not a valid run until all workflow, lifecycle, ownership, attention, suspension, and timeline invariants pass.
_Avoid_: Deserialized run, trusted snapshot

**Run revision**:
A per-run compare-and-swap counter changed by every committed state mutation. A stale expected revision means concurrent modification, not retryable success.
_Avoid_: Event sequence, schema version

**Atomic run commit**:
One SQLite transaction containing a run snapshot/revision update and its complete semantic-event batch, so neither side can become durable alone.
_Avoid_: Save then log, eventual event write

**Event sequence**:
A per-run ordinal defining authoritative semantic-event order independently from wall-clock timestamps.
_Avoid_: Timestamp order, global sequence

**Workflow**:
An opinionated identity plus a validated dependency graph describing which stages belong to a run.
_Avoid_: Pipeline script, custom graph

**Workflow scheduler**:
The execution service that repeatedly evaluates a workflow graph and advances eligible stages without workflow-specific procedures.
_Avoid_: Pipeline runner, stage script

**Provider signal**:
One provider-neutral report accepted from a provider while a stage executes, such as progress, usage, human attention, suspension, interruption, failure, or completion.
_Avoid_: Log line, provider callback

**Provider signal batch**:
An ordered group of provider signals that arise from one indivisible native record and must become durable together.
_Avoid_: In-memory follow-up, repeated raw-record acknowledgement

**Provider checkpoint**:
A durable acceptance marker proving one raw provider record was consumed, with or without semantic events, from which processing continues without silent replay.
_Avoid_: Semantic event required, in-memory cursor, artifact presence

**Provider session**:
One logical provider conversation for one stage attempt, with opaque native identity independent from any individual process invocation.
_Avoid_: Managed process, backend session, stage

**Provider session status**:
Current conversation/infrastructure condition: created, starting, active, awaiting user, completed, failed, or interrupted. It does not replace stage status.
_Avoid_: Stage status, process status

**Provider invocation**:
One managed CLI process participating in a provider session. Permission resolution or recovery may create another invocation without creating another provider session.
_Avoid_: Attempt, provider session, retry

**Native session identity**:
Opaque provider-issued conversation identity used only by its adapter to continue same logical provider session.
_Avoid_: Managed process ID, backend session ID, fabricated provider checkpoint

**Semantic provider commit**:
One atomic acceptance boundary joining run state/events, provider-session revision, artifact metadata when produced, and exact raw-output acknowledgement.
_Avoid_: Parse then save, independent cursor update

**Provider artifact**:
Human-readable stage output whose immutable metadata and content identity are persisted; downstream stages consume only declared dependency artifacts.
_Avoid_: Completion sentinel, raw provider log, canonical run state

**Permission continuation**:
Explicit human resolution that continues same provider session with only safely representable native permission scope. Broad or ambiguous approval fails closed.
_Avoid_: Global bypass, new attempt, generic resume

**Native execution policy**:
Provider-run sandbox and approval constraints selected from stage semantics while preserving native authentication, configuration, and repository instructions.
_Avoid_: Workspace mode, provider fallback, disabled sandbox

**Managed process**:
A separately persisted infrastructure attempt that supervises one exact external command for one run stage without becoming run or stage state.
_Avoid_: Provider session, stage execution, child handle

**Managed process status**:
The recoverable infrastructure condition of one external-command attempt. It does not determine semantic stage success or failure.
_Avoid_: Stage status, provider outcome

**Process backend**:
A provider-independent supervisor boundary for starting, inspecting, interrupting, reading, and cleaning managed external processes.
_Avoid_: Provider adapter, scheduler, tmux API in provider request

**Backend session**:
An opaque supervisor resource identity whose ownership must be proven before reuse, interruption, or cleanup.
_Avoid_: Provider session, tmux name as domain identity

**Command fingerprint**:
An immutable SHA-256 identity of one managed launch specification and its run/stage/attempt binding, used for recovery evidence rather than authentication.
_Avoid_: Secret hash, provider checkpoint

**Output cursor**:
A per-stream acknowledged byte offset advanced explicitly after durable consumption; reading alone never changes it.
_Avoid_: File position, line number, provider checkpoint

**Exit evidence**:
An identity-bound durable record written when the supervised command ends, distinct from absence of its backend session.
_Avoid_: Sentinel completion, tmux disappearance, stage outcome

**Process reconciliation**:
Validation of persisted process intent against owned backend session, output, runtime, and exit evidence, producing a safe current infrastructure status.
_Avoid_: Blind relaunch, session-name inference

**Role**:
An engineering responsibility assigned to a stage, independent from provider and model selection.
_Avoid_: Agent, model

**Code Quality Review**:
Independent read-only assessment of HOW an implementation is engineered: simplicity, readability, maintainability, tests, errors, unnecessary abstraction, and implementation-level regressions.
_Avoid_: Specification review, generic review

**Specification Review**:
Independent read-only assessment of WHAT behavior an implementation delivers against immutable user intent and available design evidence, focusing on Missing, Wrong, and Unrequested behavior.
_Avoid_: Code quality review, test-passing check, generic review

**Legacy review**:
General review responsibility retained as historical meaning for runs created before reviewer specialization.
_Avoid_: Code quality review, specification review

**Stage kind**:
The semantic work performed by a stage, independent from the role responsible for it.
_Avoid_: Role, provider

**Provider**:
An extensible adapter identity for a native coding-agent CLI and its native session behavior.
_Avoid_: Model, role, vendor API

**Model**:
A provider-scoped identity. Configured target may omit it to request native default; actual session model remains separately provider-confirmed.
_Avoid_: Role, provider

**Apply**:
The explicit act of transferring a completed implementation run's changes back to its source checkout.
_Avoid_: Merge, commit

**Apply operation**:
A persisted recoverable intent identifying one exact patch transfer and whether its Git effect is prepared, present in the source, recorded, or failed.
_Avoid_: Generic job, implicit retry

**Patch hash**:
A SHA-256 identity of exact apply bytes used to detect changed workspace output across crash recovery; it is evidence of operation identity, not authentication.
_Avoid_: Content signature, run revision

**Branch ownership**:
Persisted and revalidated evidence that a managed branch was created for one run and may be deleted only while its expected tip still matches.
_Avoid_: Prefix-only deletion permission

**Discard**:
The explicit terminal disposition that abandons a run's working changes while retaining its recorded history.
_Avoid_: Delete, cleanup

**Cleanup**:
An artifact-retention operation that may remove run resources without changing the run's lifecycle status.
_Avoid_: Cleaned status, discard
