//! POD — the Polycode Operator Droid.
//!
//! One pixel companion, drawn as a real sprite. Every variant is a 26×14
//! pixel image rendered at double vertical resolution with half-block
//! glyphs: each terminal cell carries two pixels (`▀` with a foreground for
//! the top pixel and a background for the bottom one), which is what lets
//! POD read as a picture instead of a pile of box-drawing characters.
//!
//! Each pipeline job is a scene: the researcher wears reading glasses next
//! to a stack of books, the architect draws with a pencil, the builder wears
//! a hard hat and takes a hammer to a laptop, the quality reviewer holds a
//! magnifying glass, the spec reviewer works through a checklist, the crowned lead
//! weighs the balance scales in Synthesis and sits at the gavel in Decision.
//! The scene follows the *selected stage* in every state, while the state
//! owns the expression (eyes, brow, mouth), the body color and the label.
//! State comes from canonical `RunStatus`/`StageStatus` and the scene from
//! the typed `StageKind`; nothing is inferred from prose.
//!
//! Sprites are painted only with semantic theme tokens — body takes the
//! state color, props take `structure`, materials take `attention`, `paper`
//! and `muted` — so Mono collapses the art to a silhouette whose features
//! survive as punched-through holes, and Vivid/ANSI recolor it without the
//! art knowing a hue. Every variant occupies exactly `MASCOT_WIDTH` ×
//! `MASCOT_HEIGHT` cells so surrounding layout never shifts.
//!
//! POD may move, but only where the surface permits it and only while the
//! domain considers the work active: the caller hands in a [`MotionFrame`],
//! and a still frame draws exactly the resting art. While a stage Runs, POD
//! works: the prop plays its two-frame cycle — the lens sweeps, the pencil
//! draws, the scales tilt, the gavel lifts — and the eyes blink on their own
//! tick of the same loop. The movement reinforces a state written elsewhere
//! in words and glyphs — it is never the evidence for it.
