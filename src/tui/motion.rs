//! When the interface is allowed to move.
//!
//! Motion is honest only when time is part of what it says: Polycode
//! considers this work active, or something just changed. Everything else
//! competes with the text the user is reading, and Polycode runs for hours.
//!
//! One contract governs the repeating half, and it is a claim about what
//! movement is *allowed to mean*:
//!
//! > Active-state motion is redundant, sparse and non-authoritative. It may
//! > reinforce an active semantic state; it must never be the evidence that
//! > work is actually alive.
//!
//! The distinction is not pedantry. `RUNNING`, the advancing elapsed, the
//! pipeline and POD's blink all report the same thing — the domain's view of
//! the run — and there is a window in which that view says Running while
//! every process behind it is already dead (see the abandoned-run grace in
//! `run_service`). A user who read the blink as proof of a live process
//! would be reading a guarantee nothing here can make. Because the movement
//! is redundant, it can be switched off entirely without losing one bit of
//! information, which is exactly the property that makes it safe to add.
//!
//! Two independent inputs decide it, and they meet as a minimum:
//!
//! * the surface states a **ceiling** — a screen the user reads never moves,
//!   whatever anyone asked for;
//! * the user states a **preference** — which can only lower that ceiling.
//!
//! Because a preference can never raise a ceiling, "reading surfaces never
//! move" is a property of this module rather than of the next contributor's
//! good taste.
