//! Mission: one project goal above the run, made of work packages.
//!
//! A run is a bounded engineering operation. A mission is the durable
//! plan that several runs serve: its work packages are engineering
//! contracts with dependencies between them, each delivered by a child
//! run, and its decisions are the design choices the plan rests on. The
//! aggregate owns every package so the invariants between them (unique
//! identity, acyclic dependencies, readiness only after integration) are
//! checked in one place, exactly as `Run` owns its stages.
//!
//! Nothing here reads a run: the application layer observes committed run
//! state and reports it through [`Mission::observe_run`], so package state
//! follows deterministic run evidence and never an agent's claim.
