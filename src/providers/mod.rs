/// How one native runtime counts the input units it reports.

/// The two supported runtimes disagree, and the difference is not cosmetic.
/// Claude Code reports `input_tokens` and `cache_read_input_tokens` as
/// disjoint dimensions: its input total excludes everything its prompt cache
/// served. Codex reports one `input_tokens` total that already contains
/// `cached_input_tokens`.
///
/// Two consequences bind every consumer. Printing a Codex input total beside
/// its cache read counts the same tokens twice. Adding the two runtimes'
/// input totals produces a number that is not a quantity of anything, because
/// the addends measure different things.
