//! Which checkout answers for a run's repository settings.
//!
//! `.polycode.toml` is the repository's own file — its `[verify]` table and
//! its `[permissions]` table — and the run's worktree is where it is read
//! from, so a change the run itself makes to it is what takes effect.
//!
//! That is the whole story only for a repository Polycode may commit to. A
//! run against a checkout of someone else's repository has nowhere to put
//! the file: the worktree is a fresh checkout of a tracked tree, so an
//! untracked file added beside it does not exist there, and committing one
//! upstream to configure a local tool is not a trade anybody should have to
//! make. Without an answer such a repository verifies by build-file guess
//! forever — `package.json` implies `npm test`, which for a monorepo is the
//! wrong suite at the wrong scope and can be red for reasons no change
//! caused.
//!
//! So the source repository the worktree was cut from answers second. An
//! untracked `.polycode.toml` there configures every run of that repository
//! without touching a tracked file. The worktree still wins when it has one,
//! which keeps the original property intact, and every reader reports which
//! of the two answered so a stage can be read back to the file that
//! configured it.
