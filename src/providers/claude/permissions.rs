//! The repository's own standing tool allowlist.
//!
//! Every Claude invocation runs with `--permission-mode dontAsk`, so anything
//! Polycode has not granted is denied outright. Derived grants only ever come
//! from a denial the user then approved, which means the first attempt at a
//! repository's own build, lint and test commands is always denied, always
//! costs a round trip through attention, and — when the command is compound —
//! can never be granted exactly at all.
//!
//! A repository answers that once, in its own `.polycode.toml`, with the rules
//! it is willing to hand every run:
//!
//! ```toml
//! [permissions]
//! allow = ["Bash(yarn jest:*)", "Bash(yarn lint:css:*)", "mcp__linear-server"]
//! ```
//!
//! The strings are native Claude Code `--allowedTools` rules, passed through
//! verbatim: this file is the repository's explicit intent, not a guess
//! Polycode derives from a denial, so it is not re-parsed or widened here. The
//! one thing refused is a rule that grants everything, because a permission
//! model that can be turned off in a config file is not one.
//!
//! On top of whatever the repository says, every run also gets [`BASELINE`] —
//! the tools an agent needs before it knows anything about the repository at
//! all. Without it the first minutes of every run in every repository are the
//! same denial storm: 342 denials across 33 measured runs, of which `grep`
//! (58), `ls` (20), `cat`, `sed`, `find` and the read-only `git` subcommands
//! account for well over a third, and `Edit`/`Write` for another 60. None of
//! those is a decision a repository should have to make.
