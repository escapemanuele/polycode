//! Mission use cases: create and shape the plan, start packages as child
//! runs, and keep package state in step with committed run evidence.
//!
//! The service owns ordering and persistence; the aggregate owns the rules.
//! Every mutation loads the mission, applies one domain operation, and
//! commits the aggregate with its event batch under compare-and-swap.
//! Run state is never inferred from anything but the run store.
